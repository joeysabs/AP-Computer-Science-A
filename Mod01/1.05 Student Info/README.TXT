PMR
I feel that I understand the purpose of print and println very well. Print will print the 
stated text whever the cursor is. Println moves the cursor down a line after printing.

I need to remember my syntax more often, I need to place semicolons more often. Also, I had
a problem with trying to organize my work without putting long blocks of just spaces in.
